                            Snowflakes were softly falling outside the window. The streets of the city were decorated with colorful lights. I saw people rushing through the streets from their unloved work, to warmth, to their families! It was already completely dark, so the hospital room was illuminated by a cold, slightly flickering light.<br>
                            I'm already used to it. As well as to a separate chamber. I told Maxim and Masha that I would be more comfortable in a regular hospital with full rooms. It wouldn't be so lonely there. But they resisted, paid a lot of money, organized the best hospital and ward.<br>
                            I sighed, rose with difficulty from the chair by the window, and returned to the hospital bed. I really wanted to be in the family circle now, only my brother and sister had their own families for a long time. And I didn't want to interfere with their quiet happiness. In the end, it was I who achieved this happiness for them.<br>

                            Our family is Svetlana and Petr Vyatkin and their three children. Stershey - Hope, I was. However, I was from my mother's previous marriage. My own father died before I was born, and I always considered my stepfather to be my father. When my mother got married a second time, I was four years old. The younger sister, Maria, was born a year later, and the younger brother Maxim two years later. We had such a big and friendly family. Mom worked as a nurse in a rural hospital. Dad is a tractor driver. We had a small but solid house, our own garden and farm.

                            I started helping my mom around the house early. She washed the dishes, swept the floors, fed the rabbits and ducks. And also my constant duty was to look after the younger ones. This often annoyed me as a child. It was difficult to call me an exemplary older sister. But then, even despite so many responsibilities, I could consider myself happy.<br>
                            Everything changed when my mother got sick. Then I was only eleven. The younger ones grew up, and it became much easier for me to look after them. After my mother's illness, all household chores fell on my shoulders. My father earned money to feed us and buy medicine for my mother.<br>
                            But it doesn't help me.<br>
                            Mom had cancer. It's so trite, isn't it? She died a year later. I was twelve. Masha is seven, Maxim is six. For all of us, it was a terrible tragedy. My father drank terribly, he was fired due to absenteeism at work. There was practically no money. And we started to starve. I tried to reason with my father, but received only slaps in the face.<br>
                            For the first time I thought about work after Masha fell into a hungry swoon. It was winter. In a panic, I ran to the neighbors, begging them to pay for cleaning their yard. I didn't want to ask them for food. They already looked at us like garbage.<br>
                            I chuckled and rolled over on the hard hospital bed. Remembering your life was painful. She was difficult. Especially for a twelve-year-old girl who put the care of her family on her shoulders. Now I realized that I could just ask for food. And most likely, I would not be denied.<br>
                            But then I cleaned the whole yard and got my money. The shop managed to buy two loaves of bread, milk and even some meat. That evening was one of the most enjoyable of my life. My father was not at home; he was wandering around somewhere with his alcoholic friends. I, having warmed up the milk, poured it into mugs, cut fresh, crispy bread and seated my brother and sister at the table.

                            From that evening I decided to start earning on my own. Of course, there was also a school. She couldn't be thrown. But I didn't visit often. At first I helped the neighbors, then I was allowed to work in the store for half a day - unloading and arranging products. The owner just felt sorry for us. And it worked for me. They paid a little, of course. But it was enough for me to dress Masha and Maxim. And even a little was enough for food.<br>
                            The garden also helped out. But the younger ones were already doing it. It was awkward at first, but every year it gets better and better. They both studied well and were obedient. I knew they were trying. I knew they were doing everything they could to make my life easier. And I was extremely grateful to them.<br>
                            I didn't go to university. I somehow finished school. Not because I was lazy or stupid. I didn't have time to study. I got a job in a small town near our village. My mom taught me how to sew and knit when I was little, so I tried my luck and got a job as a tailor's assistant in town.<br>
                            The work was difficult. They didn't pay much. But, having heard my story, Aunt Natasha (that was the name of my boss) took me to her apartment. Of course, I greatly embellished my fate by adding a moment with a sick brother and a monster father. Was it bad of me? Definitely. Did I regret it? No.<br>
                            Living with Aunt Natasha, I did not pay rent and utilities. I only occasionally buy groceries. All the money I saved was sent home. Masha and Maxim were supposed to grow up happy and healthy. After all, it was my duty to look after them.<br>
                            I worked as a tailor's assistant for three years, after which Aunt Natasha left for another city to live with her children. I stayed on the street. I urgently needed to find a job. And I found her. She started working as a nurse in a hospital. I could not find a cheap apartment or room, so I practically spent the night in the hospital. There was also a shower and beds to sleep in. But soon this was noticed by one of the doctors - Fedr Stepanovich. He was over thirty. Married, three children.

                            In today's digital age, where information is abundant and easily accessible, reading has become an essential skill for personal and professional growth. However, not all reading is created equal. Engaging in significant reading goes beyond simply scanning words on a page; it involves actively seeking valuable information and making meaningful connections. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of significant reading and how it can lead to a treasure trove of knowledge.<br>
                            Significant reading goes beyond casual reading or skimming through content. It involves a deliberate and focused approach to extract the most valuable information from a text. When practicing significant reading, the reader aims to understand the core concepts, analyze the author's arguments, and critically evaluate the information presented. It requires a combination of concentration, comprehension, and reflection.<br>
                            Beyond reading, because you have to, the importance of reading cannot go unnoticed. Reading is of great value because it provides the means by which you get to:<br>
                            Reading gets your mind working across different areas. For starters, it involves comprehension to process the words you read. Beyond that, you can use your analytical abilities, stimulate memories, and even broaden your imagination by reading words off a page.<br>
                            Reading is a neurobiological process that works out your brain muscles. As you do so, you can help to slow down cognitive decline and even decrease the rate at which memory fades. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley have even found that reading reduces the level of beta-amyloid, which is a protein in the brain that is connected to Alzheimer’s. Who knew that reading could have physical, psychological, and spiritual benefits?

                            Both reading and writing work to improve one’s communication skills. That’s why if you’re looking to become a better writer, many of the suggestions that you come across will include reading more. Reading can open your eyes, literally and figuratively, to new words. Try this next time you read: if you come across any words you read that you don’t know, take a moment to look them up and write them down. Then, remember to use your new words in your speech so you don’t forget them!<br>
                            Books can be both an escape and an adventure. When you are reading, you have the opportunity to think about things in new ways, learn about cultures, events, and people you may have never otherwise heard of, and can adopt methods of thinking that help to reshape or enhance your identity. For example, you might read a mystery novel and learn that you have a knack and interest in solving cases and paying attention to clues.<br>
                            When you read a lot, you undoubtedly learn a lot. The more you read, you can make it to the level of being considered “well-read.” This tends to mean that you know a little (or a lot) about a lot. Having a diverse set of knowledge will make you a more engaging conversationalist and can empower you to speak to more people from different backgrounds and experiences because you can connect based on shared information. Some people may argue that “ignorance is bliss,” but the truth is “knowledge is power.” And, the more you read, the more you get to know! That’s why you can bet that any educational degree you choose to obtain will involve some forms of reading (yes, even math and computer science).

                            It’s no wonder why you may see people reading by the pool, on the beach, or even on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Reading is a form of entertainment that can take you to fictional worlds or past points in time.<br>
                            Reading can teach values. Whether you read from a religious text or secular text, you can learn and teach the difference between right and wrong and explore various cultural perspectives and ways of life.<br>
                            Reading has the potential to boost your levels of creativity. Whether you read about a specific craft or skill to boost it or you are reading randomly for fun, the words could spark new ideas or images in your mind. You may also start to find connections between seemingly disparate things, which can make for even more creative outputs and expressions.<br>
                            f you don’t think that strengthening your brain is enough of a benefit, there’s even more good news. Reading has also been proven to lower stress as it increases relaxation. When the brain is fully focused on a single task, like reading, the reader gets to benefit from meditative qualities that reduce stress levels.<br>
                            Reading is a gateway to learning anything about everything. It helps you discover new things and educate yourself in any area of life you are interested in. You can find a book on just about any subject you can imagine, dive in and start learning. Your child can learn about their interests (and even themselves) through reading things they enjoy.<br>
                            When we watch television or a movie, all the information is given to us on the screen – there’s nothing we need to imagine. A book in its pure form is just words on a page, and our minds have to do the work, imagining the words coming to life. This does wonders to develop our creativity and imagination.<br>

                            Giving your child access to a world of words is one of the best ways to improve their vocabulary and enhance their spelling skills. New knowledge that’s gained through enjoyment has a tendency to stick and doesn’t even feel like work! Both their written and spoken communication abilities can be improved through regular reading.

                            TO WHAT expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several departments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer that can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so contriving the interior structure of the government as that its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea, I will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and structure of the government planned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own;<br>
                            And consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear.

And also my constant duty was to look after the younger ones. This often annoyed me as a child. It was difficult to call me an exemplary older sister. But then, even despite so many responsibilities.<br>
                            Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.<br>
                            It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.

                            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsue<br>
                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br>
                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
